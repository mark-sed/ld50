# Topic: Delay the inevitable 

Rogue like turn based game, but all enemies move at once and once the player moves (can move really fast).

There is always an indicator how far the boss is and player runs through rooms, but has to find the exit of those rooms, which might be random (always either up, left or right).

Player may or may not fight, should probably only take up fights that are needed. Killing an enemy might give some reward though.

* Boss gets faster with rooms.
* Powerups/items
* Maybe even character abilities?

## Alternative

The boss distance is your HP?

## Start

You enter a boss room and get hit for 99 % HP (hearts), so you start running and the boss is chasing you.
