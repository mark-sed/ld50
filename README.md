# Dungeon Escape - A Game for Ludum Dare 50

This game was made for Ludum Dare 50 in compo section in 48 hrs (actually little bit less) by me (Marek Sedláček).

**[LINK TO LUDUM DARE GAME PAGE]()** (look there for more info).

Dungeon Escape is a turn-based rogue like game with a little twist -- You're running away from the boss. 
The defeat might be inevitable, but you have to do your best to delay it and get as far as you can.

Navigate your way out of the dungeon, while the boss is chasing your. Enemies won't attack you, but you can choose to attack them, but then you receive damage as well.

You can let me know the furthest you got (room number) and I'll post it here in my little personal scoreboard. In case you got to the hidden (and I would say impossible) "section" be sure to let me know about that!

## Controls
**W, A, S, D (or arrows)** - To move.

**M** - Mute music.

That's it! If you want to interact with something, step on its square (walking into enemies will attack them).


## About the game(dev)
This is a COMPO entry (made within 48 hours) all by me (the art, music, sound effects, animations, code).  
I made this in Java using my custom hand made engine (that's why it's somewhat small, but might have some problems with portability... oops).

## How to play
There is purposefully not too many information about how to play, since I personally like that in rogue like games -- dying and retrying with new knowledge and strategy is one of the fun aspects. But in case you don't like this or want to get some things clear, here's some info:

* You have health regeneration.
* The red arrow at the bottom tells you how close a boss is.
* Picking up bananas slows boss down (he might not have feet, but he still can slip on a peel... at least I think).
* To escape the boss find the ladder (just as when escaping a room).


## Cheats
If you get stuck or just want to have some fun after real runs:

**F8 + N** - Skip current level.

**F8 + C** - Money cheat.

**F8 + H** - HP cheat.
